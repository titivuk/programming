General backtracking format

```js
// let curr represent the thing you are building
// it could be an array or a combination of variables

function backtrack(curr) {
    if (base case) {
        Increment or add to answer
        return
    }

    for (iterate over input) {
        Modify curr
        backtrack(curr)
        Undo whatever modification was done to curr
    }
}
```
